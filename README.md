# Homeownership_Affordability
This data analysis project explores the affordability of homeownership rates through an exploratory analysis and a series of hypothesis tests culminating in a final essay-style report.

The main dataset used for analysis was retrieved from HUD Exchange, and can be accessed here: https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/location-affordability-index-v-3/explore. The remaining supplemental datasets are attached to this repo as CSV files.
